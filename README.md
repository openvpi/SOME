SOME: Singing-Oriented MIDI Extractor.

> WARNING
>
> This project is under beta version now. No backward compatibility is guaranteed.

## Overview

SOME is a MIDI extractor that can convert singing voice to MIDI sequence, with the following advantages:

1. Speed: 9x faster than real-time on an i5 12400 CPU, and 300x on a 3080Ti GPU.
2. Low resource dependency: SOME can be trained on custom dataset, and can achieve good results with only 3 hours of training data.
3. Functionality: SOME can produce non-integer MIDI values, which is specially suitable for DiffSinger variance labeling.

## Getting Started

> 中文教程 / Chinese Tutorials: [Text](https://openvpi-docs.feishu.cn/wiki/RaHSwdMQvisdcKkRFpqclhM7ndc), [Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1my4y1N7VR)

### Installation

SOME requires Python 3.8 or later. We strongly recommend you create a virtual environment via Conda or venv before installing dependencies.

1. Install PyTorch 2.1 or later following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) according to your OS and hardware.

2. Install other dependencies via the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) For better pitch extraction results, please download the RMVPE pretrained model from [here](https://github.com/yxlllc/RMVPE/releases) and extract it into `pretrained/` directory.

### Inference via pretrained model

Download pretrained model of SOME from [releases](https://github.com/openvpi/SOME/releases) and extract them somewhere.

To infer with CLI, run the following command:

```bash
python infer.py --model CKPT_PATH --wav WAV_PATH
```

This will load model at CKPT_PATH, extract MIDI from audio file at WAV_PATH and save a MIDI file. For more useful options, run

```bash
python infer.py --help
```

To infer with Web UI, run the following command:

```bash
python webui.py --work_dir WORK_DIR
```

Then you can open the gradio interface through your browser and use the models under WORK_DIR following the instructions on the web page. For more useful options, run

```bash
python webui.py --help
```

### Training from scratch

_Training scripts are uploaded but may not be well-organized yet. For the best compatibility, we suggest training your own model after a stable release in the future._
